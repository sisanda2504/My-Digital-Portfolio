## Career Counselling Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of my work readiness training, I participated in a career counselling module. We were given certain scenarios to read and reflect on, each presenting different career planning challenges and choices.

**Task:**  
My task was to analyze each scenario, identify the key issues, and reflect on how I would respond or what I would do differently. I also needed to consider how these scenarios related to my own career planning.

**Action:**  
I carefully read through each scenario, took notes on the important points, and compared the situations to my own experiences and aspirations. I answered the related questions in the module, as shown in my evidence screenshot, and discussed my thoughts with peers for additional perspective.

**Result:**  
Through this process, I developed a deeper understanding of the importance of goal setting, self-awareness, and proactive planning in career development. I now feel more confident in making informed decisions about my career path and know how to apply these lessons to my own journey.
