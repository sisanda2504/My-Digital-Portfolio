## CV and Submission Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
For the final part of my work readiness training, I was tasked with creating and submitting a professional CV. This was my first time building a CV from scratch.

**Task:**  
My goal was to design a CV that effectively showcases my skills, education, and experience, and to submit it as part of my digital portfolio.

**Action:**  
I researched best practices for CV writing, used a clear and modern template, and tailored the content to highlight my strengths and achievements. I also reviewed examples and incorporated feedback from my lecturer.

**Result:**  
I successfully created and submitted a professional CV, as shown in my evidence. The process taught me how to present myself to potential employers and the importance of keeping my CV updated. I am now confident in my ability to create application documents for future opportunities.
