## Personality Assessment Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of the work readiness program, I completed a personality assessment and was given scenarios to interpret, focusing on how personality traits relate to career choices.

**Task:**  
I needed to analyze my personality assessment results and reflect on how my traits would affect my performance in different work environments.

**Action:**  
I reviewed the feedback from the assessment, considered the scenarios provided, and compared the findings to my own experiences in group and individual work. I thought about how my personality could be an asset or a challenge in my chosen field.

**Result:**  
I realized that my analytical and supportive nature makes me well-suited for collaborative and technical roles. I also recognized areas where I can improve, such as being more assertive in group settings. This awareness will help me adapt and succeed in my future career.
